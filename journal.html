		Today we worked on the Math.random() function. This function outputs a random number from 0 to 1.   
	</p> 

	<h3><p style = "color:white;" > 1/17/25 </p></h3>

		In class we have been working on how to use arrays in making different programs. I'm making a random wishlist generator that provides random things to put on a wishlist. The project is called wishlist maker. If you click the small white box on the side of the images, it gives random ideas to put on a wishlist for a birthday or even the holidays! In the future, I'm going to add more images.

	<h3><p style = "color:white;" > 1/21/25 </p></h3>
	<p style = "color:white;" > 
		I used the array method that we learned in class so I could make a random picture generator of my friend Astrid. When you click on the box in the center of the screen, it generates a random. number and that number is the index of the image in the images array.

	<h3><p style = "color:white;" > 2/14/25 </p></h3>

		HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!!!! I made my valentines project for some people in my house. I used the confetti project that I did but also used an array to click through the pictures. My friend Astrid and I are doing a competition to see whos project is better and we're gonna get our house members to vote.

		Review day. Today in class we reviewed any questions we had about things we did in the past. We went over how to make multiple divs and also how to use forloops. We mainly just clairified some questions we had revolving around function use as well. I understand it now.
